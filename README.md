# Starter for deploying a deep learning model that segments objects from street images
### Currently on hold because of cloud payment issues

This repo can be used as a starting point to deploy [Street image Object Segmentation](https://street-image-segmentation.onrender.com) models on Render.

Also need to train the model using all data (currently 10% data has been used and with very few epochs)
